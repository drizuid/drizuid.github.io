I’ll discuss what I had, my plan, and what I moved to here a bit. If any of you have read my previous post, AT&amp;T Uverse RG Bypass, then you know I am a big fan of bypassing the ATT provided RG to use my own equipment. With my 1000/1000 service, the fiber (alt optic unfortunately) came into the ATT ONT, directly to my router (initially ERL3, later ER4) which then went to my core switch to my access switches. The plan initially began to form because rather than faking the 802.1x on my router, I could instead use my own ONT and fully bypass everything ATT had in my home. Some people can do this with GPON 1G or less service, but in the former bellsouth areas, we had alt optic which uses a 1550nm wavelength rather than 1490nm wavelength, so the GPON bypass wasn’t possible for me. My plan was to get a 2.5G+ capable router with sufficient disk, memory, and cpu to handle routing at whatever speed I went with. I ordered two devices: A GW-R86S-G2, and an N6005/4xi226-V

It works extremely well and I’ve been very pleased not only with the application itself, but also with the support from the authelia devs. That said, there are some features I wish authelia had that they do not yet. The biggest feature is SAML support. As many of you know, I focus heavily on Cisco Unified Communications. Cisco UC supports SAML SSO and I haven’t had anything in my lab that would let me tinker with this. Authentik can do everything authelia does plus some extras, which include SAML. I will say that I am typing this as I wing setting it up and I can already see that authentik is not as simple to configure/deploy as authelia. As a note, since I am documenting this as I do it, I will include any mistakes and how i resolve those mistakes. This is my first time touching authentik and I am purely going off the documentation available at https://goauthentik.io/docs/.

The original build was when my oldest (turning 13) was 7 and my middle child (turning 10) was 4. They’ve had the same AMD R7 240 graphics cards since then. Unfortunately, the games they play which began as browser based games and minecraft, have upgraded to things like roblox, fortnite, and somehow minecraft’s blocks needs more juice. So here we are. Over labor day, my friend (thanks @ctark) pointed a sale at antonline out to me where they had RTX 2060’s in stock for 224$ each. First, I’ve not seen a graphics card in stock for a long time and second, while 224$ is well over what I might have planned to do for them, I thought it was worth it. Just looking at benchmarks, the new card is effectively almost 1500% better, so I decided to jump in.

IPv6 in docker containers. For my testing, I will be using linuxserver.io containers, as being part of the team allows me to easily fix anything that prevents full functionality.
I guess to start, a big thing I found is most ipv6 guides, including the official documentation, tells you how to enable ipv6 for the default bridge. As we all know, the default bridge is trash, it doesnt work like a custom bridge and causes a number of issues. You may also see guides that lead you to setup nds proxy which works, but it introduces a HUGE amount of latency. When I tested the NDS proxy method, i couldn’t stand how slow it was and quickly reverted the change. So, let’s get into how I set it up, note that I am not claiming to have the best method, the most efficient method, the most secure method or anything of the sort. This is just how I set it up to get what I wanted working in a way I was OK with. ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2022-01-11 17:22:20 +0000 UTC'>January 11, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Will</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to IPv6 with docker containers" href=/2022/01/ipv6-with-docker-containers/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Cisco UC – Secure LDAP bug</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>While working with a client this week, I encountered an undocumented bug with secure LDAP authentication.

I’ve been meaning to write this up for a while, but I’ve been lazy/busy. As some may know, I relocated with my family from Nashville to Kentucky when my wife accepted her new position. As a consultant, I have the freedom to live and work from anywhere, so moving to improve my wife’s career was no big deal. Fortunately, a new home offers the chance to correct oversights on the last one. One of the first things I did was take the plans and determine how I wanted my network to look. I knew I wanted a collapsed core with access layer devices on each floor. I started by estimating how many wired connections per floor I would want. After this, I segmented those out to determine how many needed POE.

After reading this, look at the bug I discovered when enabling secure LDAP on UC applications here.
As many of you are aware, Microsoft began the process to deprecate LDAP access into Active Directory back in March. You can read cisco’s advisory here: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/trouble/12_5_1/fieldNotice/cucm_b_fn-secure-ldap-mandatory-ad.html
Basically, this means we need to do a fairly simple swap from LDAP to LDAPS. I just completed one for a client’s CUC and CUCM and it took about 30 minutes start to finish.
