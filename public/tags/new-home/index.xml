      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I posted about swapping to 2G service which would move me from alt-optic gpon to xgs-pon and then allow me to fully bypass the ATT ont and not even use 802.11x configuration. I thought it was pretty detailed, but I was asked about some of the outputs during the setup. Fortunately, I kept the notes in my notepad instance and can expand on things. This is an addendum to the original article &lt;a href=&#34;https://drizuid.github.io/2023/03/moving-to-opnsense-and-2gbps-internet/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Home â€“ New Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: This post has a lot of pictures!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this up for a while, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been lazy/busy. As some may know, I relocated with my family from Nashville to Kentucky when my wife accepted her new position. As a consultant, I have the freedom to live and work from anywhere, so moving to improve my wife&amp;rsquo;s career was no big deal. Fortunately, a new home offers the chance to correct oversights on the last one. One of the first things I did was take the plans and determine how I wanted my network to look. I knew I wanted a collapsed core with access layer devices on each floor. I started by estimating how many wired connections per floor I would want. After this, I segmented those out to determine how many needed POE. The biggest thing was ensuring I left room for growth. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.longoconsulting.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/rack-design-1024x701.png&#34; alt=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
